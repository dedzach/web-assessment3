A network is a group of computers that communicate between one another in  different ways. 
The internet is what we call a group of networks. So in a sense it's like the earth while networks are the indiviual states, and countries. 
When we connect to the internet, everyone is given a IP Address which is usually assigned to you by your ISP. This IP address helps find where computers are on a network and are
how our computers communicate each other and servers(which have their own IP Address). Websites however, are usually indentified by their Hostnames or URLs because they're easier to
remember than a bunch of numbers.
Whenever you click on a link or URL through your browser, your computer is sending a GET request for data from a server. 
Once the server receives your request, the server responds with the it's code allowing your browser to view the html page and anything else embeded in the code including forms,
videos, images, and more.
